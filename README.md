# kbclip

this program will compress all .mp4 files in a directory, for me it has cut the size of the clips by about half (65%), without a noticable drop in quality, I think it only works on Nvidia GPU's but you can change the encoding algorithm if you need.

This will compress 4 at a time, you can change that to how powerful you think your GPU is.

It does search subdirectories

## IT WILL DELETE THE UNCOMPRESSED FILE AND ADD COMPRESSED_ TO THE START OF THE FILENAME
